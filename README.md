DOMAIN: Botanical research

**Context**
A University is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have have invested on curating sample images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo

**Description**
The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data

**Objective**
University’s management require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo

**Tasks**
1. Importing the data. Analyzing the dimensions of the data. Visualizing the data.
2. Training, tuning and testing AIML image classifier model using:
  • Supervised learning algorithms for training
  
  • Neural networks for training
  
  • CNN for training

3. Comparing the results from the above steps.
4. Pickling the best performing model.
5. Import a test image to predict the class. Displaying the image. Using the best trained image classifier model to predict the class

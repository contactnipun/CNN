# CNN
Using Convolutional Neural Networks to solve Computer Vision Problems

# Part 1
DOMAIN: Botanical research

**Context**
A University is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have have invested on curating sample images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo

**Description**
The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data

**Objective**
University’s management require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo

**Tasks**
1. Importing the data. Analyzing the dimensions of the data. Visualizing the data.
2. Training, tuning and testing AIML image classifier model using:

      • Supervised learning algorithms for training

      • Neural networks for training

      • CNN for training

3. Comparing the results from the above steps.
4. Pickling the best performing model.
5. Import a test image to predict the class. Displaying the image. Using the best trained image classifier model to predict the class


# Part 2
DOMAIN: Botanical research

**Context**
A University is undergoing research involving understanding the characteristics of flowers. They already have have invested on curating sample images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a flower’s species from a photo

**Data Description** 
The dataset comprises of images from 17 plant species. Can be downloaded from TensorFlow [ tflearn.datasets.oxflower17 as oxflower17 ]

**Objective** 
University requires an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a flower’s species from a photo 

**Steps**
1. Importing the data. Analyzing the dimensions of the data.
2. Preprocessing the data.
3. Data visualisation:

      • Displaying the images
      
      • Displaying the labels
      
      • Displaying images vs labels
      
      • Apply different filters [ for example: blur, contour, edge detection, emboss, smooth etc.] on the images and displaying the image.
      
4. Training, tuning and testing AIML image classifier model using:

      • Using supervised learning algorithms for training
      
      • Using neural networks for training
      
      • Using CNN for training
      
      • Using various CNN with transferred learning models for training
      
      • Comparing the results from the above step.
      
5. Creating a GUI to import the image “Prediction.jpg” and using the above designed AIML image classification model to predict the class/label of this image.
